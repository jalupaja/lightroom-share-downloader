# Lightroom Share Downloader
> Download "lightroom.adobe.com/shares" folders in one go

This script exists because the lightroom share has no options to download all images.
This is hacked together, inefficient and might not work at all.

## Installation
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage 
`python lightroom-downloader.py`
